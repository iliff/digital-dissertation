title: Why Markdown?
---

## Simple

Markdown is becoming widely used by web writers because it is a simple writing syntax that allows writers to focus on content and not on the print formatting settings that dominate word processing tools like MS Word and Pages. 

## Portable

Markdown can be 'published' to many different reading environments (HTML for web, Word or PDF for print, etc.) and style is kept separate from the content so each reading environment can handle the markdown as it sees best fit. 

## Archivable

Because markdown is a raw text markup language, it does not require special software to read or to write. Thus, markdown documents can be archived without needing to archive separate word processing software in order to access the content.
