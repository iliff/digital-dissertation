## Create GitHub account

[GitHub account types and pricing](https://github.com/pricing)

* Free would be sufficient if keeping repo private and only inviting a few collaborators to engage
* PRO is free for students (need institutional email address)
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/schools) could be a good solution for the institution at large
* register for the [GitHub Student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for free added functionality

## Setup Repository for GitHub Pages

* In the GitHub pages section set GitHub pages to run from master/docs folder
* Click Choose theme and then choose the theme you want from the list and click select theme (you can always get a different theme later)
    * This template assumes the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
    * If you choose a different theme, you may need to edit the default layout file or even remove it.
